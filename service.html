</br>
<br>“Thila” means sesame or “yellu” in tamil. “Homa” means yaga. Sesame is the grain used to invite the ancestors in the act of performing last rits. So, while performing thilahoma, chanting mantras and offering sesame to agni, we pray to Lord Mahavishnu that the souls of our ancestors attain “Mukthi” or “SathGathi” (Remains at the lotus feet of Lord Mahavishnu).So, by doing thila homa, we get blessings from our ancestors and also our prayers will be fulfilled.

WHY SHOULD ONE DO THILA HOMAM IN RAMESWARAM?
According to Karma Theory, It is our action of Virtue causes Punya and our action of Sin causes Papa. Jeevatma, An individual is the mixture of both Punya and papa karmas, who takes Birth-Death cycle, having Father-Son Relationship, and also experiencing Pleasure and Pain in his/her real life.

The horoscope shows these karmic benefits as a tool. The position of planets reflects his action of virtue as punya karma by favouring their wishes and his action of Sins as Papa karma through Dosha. So if one having pitru dosha in his/her Horoscope, It can be caused by certain karma of their family or their ancestors. Pitru Dosha is predicted by the position of Shani, Surya and the kulika in the horoscope.

Some factors are listed,</br>
<br>1. It can happen if someone in our family or in the past died by accident, suicide or untimely death.</br>

<h1 style="font size:50px;text-align:center;">3.THITHI</h1></br>
<br>Thithi in Rameswaram- Death anniversary Ritual:</br>
<br>According to our Hindu calendar, the death day of our ancestors comes year after year. So, if we know the death date and timing, we can predict by taking notes of Maasham( chitra to panguni), either Shukla Paksha (those fortnights when the moon grows) or Krishna paksha (those fortnights when the moon wears out), & thithi (Prathama to chathurdashi or Amavasa or Pournami) and apply into the current year Hindu calender.

If we dont know the death date or timing, then the auspicious day for doing thithi pooja is the day of Amavasya. In Rameswaram, Thithi can be performed on a particular day or in any Amavasya days.</br>
<br>Traditional ways for performing Thithi:</br>
<br>For First year death anniversary, We perform Thithi pooja which includes kalasha pooja homa and vegetable dhana all in pooja mandapa. The procedure is as follows.</br>

<br>1. Ganesha Puja:</br>

<br>We do begin with the Ganesh Puja, in order to overcome all the obstacles and to attain Kaarya Siddhi as well as its benefit.</br>

<br>In this pooja, we worship Lord Varuna and sprinkle kalasha theertha for the sake of the purity of our mind, body and the puja surroundings.</br>

<br>4. Thithi – Rameswaram method:</br>

<br>For the satisfaction of our ancestors, We first invite them in this pooja, and in the names of our ancestors. we do some “Dhaanas” like Vegetables, Dhothi etc to any Brahmins.</br>

<br>5. Homa:</br>

<br>Navagruha Homa for family welfare and pitru mukthi homa for ancestors will be done.</br>

<br>6. Pinda karma:</br>

<br>Offering Pinda karma makes our ancestors to get satisfied by this pooja process and also through which, we show our gratitude to whole 21 generation of our ancestors.</br>

<br>7. Prasadam:</br>

<br>Pandit ji do give pooja prasadham to the Devotees. At this time, the pooja dakshina is given to Pandit and complete the whole ritual process.

<br>


<h1 style="font size:50px;text-align:center;">4.NAGA PRADISHTA</h1></br>


<br>In Naga Pradishta, we worship Rahu and Ketu in one naga idol by performing dedicated pooja, Japa, Homa, Abisheka and finally taking to do Shila Naga pradishta in a temple. It is performed to releive from kala sarpa dosham. Kala Sarpa dosham is identified by</br>

<br>(1)position of surya in 8th house from rahu or (2)following position of rahu or ketu:</br>

<br>(A)8th house from chandra: rahu or ketu</br>

<br>(B)6,7, or 8 house from lagna: rahu.</br>

<br>If a person having kala sarpa dosha, for a certain period of time , he/she may face some obstacles in getting marriage, childbirth, settle in one profession or business or in family issues. So it is better for them to do Naga pradishta in Rameshwaram to remove all such obstacles.

REASON FOR CAUSING KALA SARPA DOSHA IN HOROSCOPE:
According to Jyothisha Shastra, In a person’s Horoscope, the position of planets reflects his action of virtue as punya by favouring their wishes and his action of Sins as Papa through Dosha. The horoscope shows these karmic benefits as a tool. So If one gets affected by a Dosha, it means it is the reflection of his/her papa karma. If a person gets Naga dosha or kala sarpa dosha in his horoscope, it is caused because of involving Jeeva himsa by killing or torturing living creatures such as snakes, reptiles etc..

Why do we do Naga Prathishta in Rameshwaram?

When Mahavishnu took Ramavataram, Lord Adisesha appeared with him as Lakshmana and did shiva linga pooja in Rameshwaram. Likewise, in Krishna Avatar, Lord Adishesha appeared as Balaram, the elder brother of Krishna and did Shiva ling pooja in Rameswaram. He also incarnated as Patanjali Siddha and did pooja to Lord Shiva in Rameswaram temple. Later he started to be in the state of yoga Nishta at the shrine of Lord Nataraja. So it is believed that his grace of vibration will eradicate kala sarpa dosha and its obstacles. so we do Naga prathishta in Rameshwaram.</br>

<br>Benefits:</br>

<br>Getting marriage.</br>
<br>Having child.</br>
<br>Success in business and employment.</br>
<br>Health and wealth.</br>
<br>Love and affection between couple as well as family people.
